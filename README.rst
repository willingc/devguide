This guide covers how to contribute to CPython.

Among core developers and Pythonistas, the guide is commonly known by its
nickname, **"the devguide"**. Its official home is
https://docs.python.org/devguide/.


Contributors
------------

If you wish to help with **the devguide**, we welcome you. Read the guide,

When you are ready to submit a PR (pull request), please submit
it to the
`github branch <https://github.com/python/devguide/tree/github>`_.
A core developer will review your PR and provide feedback for enhancements or
accept it. Remember, our core developers are volunteers so please be patient
and respectful of their time.

An up-to-date mirror of this repository is also available at
http://cpython-devguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ (use the mirror if
you want to verify that a recent change worked well as the copy on

Code and Community Wisdom
-------------------------

Long time Pythoneer Tim Peters succinctly channels the BDFL's guiding
principles for Python's design into 20 aphorisms, only 19 of which
have been written down.


The Zen of Python
=================

::

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
